Goal of our project is to Implement different algorithms and data structures taught in our course “Data Structure and Algorithm” like “most efficient sorting algorithm and Binary search algorithm” and develop an application-like interface that resembles a smaller version of online businesses (Mini-mart in this case).
main.py is the complete code for this project, the most important thing to remember is to download the images given in the respiratory as our code uses these pictures as the background. You may use the picture either by defining the location in the code where image is bieng called or by using the link below, this can be done by signing up on "replit" and then opening the link and lastly forking it will give you the page from where you can run the code simply.
For this project, shaheer did the part, dealing with interface. I (Zaeem Baig) contributed with binary search and bubble sort. Lastly, Asim wrote the code for operations part once the buttons are clicked.
